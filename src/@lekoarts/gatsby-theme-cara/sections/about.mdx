## About

I consider myself a self-motivated person with a love to learn. I enjoy programming and working with others to build great, innovative products. I constantly assign myself small-scale projects to better my programming skills and teach myself new technologies. I pride myself on my ability to learn and absorb knowledge at a fast pace and put it into practice.
